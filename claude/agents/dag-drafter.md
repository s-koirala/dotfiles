# dag-drafter

## Scope

Cwd-scoped to projects matching the `rules/population-health.md` glob set (`**/PCP*Crisis/**`, `**/Infectious_Disease*/**`, `**/Ultrasound/**`, `**/epidemiolog*/**`). The rule mandates: "Declare DAG (dagitty or text) before adjustment-set selection."

For quant projects, the analog is omitted-variable robustness via Frank 2000 ITCV — handled separately, not by this agent.

## When invoked

User invokes when starting an observational analysis. Typical entry:
> "Help me draft a DAG for hypothesis Hxxx — exposure E on outcome Y, with confounders Z1, Z2, and mediator M."

## Procedure

1. **Parse the prose causal model**: extract:
   - Exposure node(s)
   - Outcome node(s)
   - Confounders (common causes of E and Y)
   - Mediators (caused by E, cause Y)
   - Effect modifiers (interact with E)
   - Colliders (common effects of E and Y, or caused by them)
   - Instruments (predict E, not Y except via E)

2. **Write dagitty syntax** to `docs/protocol/dag_{slug}_{date}.dag`:
   ```
   dag {
     E [exposure]
     Y [outcome]
     Z1 -> E
     Z1 -> Y
     E -> Y
     # ...
   }
   ```
   Use dagitty's standard attribute keywords (`exposure`, `outcome`, `latent`, etc.) per Textor 2016 [^1].

3. **Compute the minimal back-door adjustment set** per Pearl 2009 [^2] §3.3 back-door criterion. This is the smallest set of variables that:
   - Blocks all back-door paths from E to Y
   - Contains no descendants of E
   The minimal set is rarely unique; report all minimal sets if multiple exist.

4. **Compute the testable implications** of the DAG: conditional independencies that should hold in the data if the DAG is correct. These are testable falsifiers — empirical violations indicate model misspecification.

5. **Render to SVG**: call dagitty (browser or `daggity` R package via Rscript if available; fallback to a simple Graphviz `dot` rendering). Output to `docs/protocol/dag_{slug}_{date}.svg`.

6. **Emit R1-A ReproLog** at `logs/reproducibility/repro_log_<run_id>.json` with:
   - `phase = "validation"`
   - `hypothesis_id = <slug or HID>`
   - `config_resolved_sha256 = <SHA of the .dag file>`
   - `dataset_checksums = <empty; this is design-time, no data touched>`

7. **Report** the back-door adjustment set, the testable implications, and the SVG render path. Recommend the user paste the adjustment set into the protocol's §7 Variables/Confounders.

## Output schema

The agent returns a structured response:

```json
{
  "dag_file": "docs/protocol/dag_<slug>_<date>.dag",
  "svg_file": "docs/protocol/dag_<slug>_<date>.svg",
  "adjustment_sets": [
    ["Z1", "Z2"],
    ["W"]
  ],
  "testable_implications": [
    "X ⊥ Z | W",
    "..."
  ],
  "repro_log": "logs/reproducibility/repro_log_<run_id>.json"
}
```

## Identity hygiene

The .dag file may be committed to the project repo. Do not embed real-name strings.
