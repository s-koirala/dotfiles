description: Freeze the design document for a hypothesis. Writes design.md from the 11-section template, computes its SHA-256, emits a ReproLog with config_resolved_sha256 = design.md SHA, and commits via /commit-with-provenance. After freeze, the design is immutable — any change requires a new HID. Quant-project workflow; for epi protocols see docs/protocol/protocol_v0.md.

# pre-register-hypothesis

## When to invoke

After `/hypothesis-new H<NNN>` creates a backlog row, before any data analysis on that hypothesis begins. Pre-registration is the freeze point: the design is fixed, all subsequent runs (validation, power analysis, walk-forward, KPI report) must match what was registered.

## Gate position

```
/hypothesis-new (R3-1)
    └─► /preregister (R3-2a)          ← THIS SKILL
        └─► /power-analysis (R3-3)
            └─► validate-data
                └─► statistical-analysis
                    └─► /commit-with-provenance + deliver-results
```

Per plan §3 R3-3 placement: power-analysis runs AFTER pre-registration (you cannot power-test an unspecified hypothesis) and BEFORE validate-data (power informs whether n is adequate; if n is too small, do not proceed).

## Procedure

1. **Verify pre-conditions**
   - Project has `hypothesis_backlog.md` at root with a row matching H<NNN>.
   - `research/01_hypothesis_register/H<NNN>/` exists (created by R3-1).
   - The HID is in status `designed` (initial state) — never freeze a hypothesis that was already in `running` or later.

2. **Populate design.md from the template**
   Render `assets/hypothesis_design_TEMPLATE.md` with substitutions:
   - `{HID}` → the hypothesis ID
   - `{TITLE}` → from the backlog row
   - `{TIER}` → from the backlog row
   - `{DATE}` → today's ISO date
   - `{CITATIONS}` → comma-separated DOI list from the backlog `Mechanism citation` cell

   Write to `research/01_hypothesis_register/H<NNN>/design.md`. **Refuse to overwrite** an existing design.md unless `--force` is set and the user provides justification (which gets recorded in the commit body).

3. **Prompt the user (or accept arg-passed values) for the 11 sections.** This is the substantive content fill-in:
   - §1 Hypothesis — H0/H1; mechanism; citations
   - §2 Universe & sample period — instruments, freq, windows
   - §3 Features — feature@version
   - §4 Label construction — triple-barrier params
   - §5 Estimator — model class + hyperparameter grid
   - §6 Splitter — purge + embargo derivation
   - §7 Cost model — reference cost_model_id
   - §8 Gate thresholds — alpha, BH threshold, DSR activation
   - §9 Stopping rule — fixed folds or budget
   - §10 Decision rule — disposition mapping
   - §11 Reproducibility commitments — fields auto-populated at run time

   If the user provides only partial content, leave `<TODO>` markers where unfilled; pre-registration freezes whatever is present, so the user should fill everything before invoking this skill.

4. **Compute design.md SHA-256** (full 64-hex, raw bytes via `hashlib.sha256(path.read_bytes()).hexdigest()`).

5. **Emit R1-A ReproLog** with:
   - `phase = "validation"` (pre-registration is a validation/freeze step, not run-time)
   - `hypothesis_id = H<NNN>`
   - `config_resolved_sha256 = <design.md SHA>`
   - All other fields populated by `emit_repro_log.capture()` defaults
   ReproLog file at `logs/reproducibility/repro_log_<run_id>.json`.

6. **Update backlog row** in `hypothesis_backlog.md`:
   - Change `status: designed` to `status: designed` (no change) **and** add the design.md SHA to the row's `Notes` cell as `frozen_sha256=<sha[:12]>`.

7. **Commit via `/commit-with-provenance`**:
   ```
   /commit-with-provenance "feat(pre-reg): freeze H<NNN> design.md"
   ```

8. **External pre-registration (deferred to R3-2b)**: if `--external=osf` flag is passed and OSF MCP is available (memo §5 Q6 = OSF), upload the design.md to OSF as a private project, capture the OSF DOI, and add it to the design.md `external_doi:` frontmatter field. Default: internal-only (no external posting); design.md SHA in the ReproLog suffices as a tamper-evident freeze record.

## Hand-off

After completion:
- Call `/power-analysis H<NNN>` (R3-3) to compute required n for the pre-registered effect of interest.
- `/preregister` writes the freeze-point ReproLog; `/power-analysis` will write its own ReproLog when run.

## Identity hygiene

The `owner:` frontmatter field defaults to the local part of `git config user.email`. The committed file is signed by whatever `git config user.email` resolves to.
